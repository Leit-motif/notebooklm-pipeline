# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a module to store generated MP3 files in Google Cloud Storage and manage public access.
# Details:
1. Create a StorageClient class using the Google Cloud Storage Python client
2. Implement method to upload MP3 files to the /episodes/ directory in the GCS bucket
3. Generate unique filenames based on date/time and content
4. Set appropriate ACLs for public access
5. Implement method to generate public URLs for uploaded files
6. Add error handling for upload failures
7. Implement cleanup functionality for temporary files
8. Add logging for storage operations
9. Implement file existence checking to prevent duplicates

# Test Strategy:
Upload test MP3 files to the GCS bucket and verify they are accessible via public URLs. Test error handling by simulating upload failures. Verify ACLs are correctly set by accessing files from an unauthenticated browser session.
