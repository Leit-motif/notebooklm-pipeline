# Task ID: 14
# Title: Create FastAPI Service Skeleton
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the basic FastAPI application structure with configuration and dependency management.
# Details:
1. Initialize a new Python project with proper directory structure
2. Set up virtual environment and dependency management (requirements.txt or poetry)
3. Install FastAPI and required dependencies (uvicorn, pydantic, google-cloud-storage, requests)
4. Create main.py with FastAPI application initialization
5. Implement basic health check endpoint (/health)
6. Set up configuration management for environment variables
7. Implement logging configuration
8. Create Dockerfile for containerization
9. Add README.md with setup instructions

# Test Strategy:
Run the application locally and verify the health check endpoint returns a 200 status code. Test the configuration loading with different environment variables. Verify the Docker container builds and runs correctly.
