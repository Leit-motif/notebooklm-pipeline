# Description: Set up continuous deployment to Google Cloud Run for the microservice.
# Details:

4. Set up environment variables for the Cloud Run service
5. Configure service scaling parameters
6. Set up custom domain if required
7. Implement health checks for the deployed service
8. Configure logging and monitoring
