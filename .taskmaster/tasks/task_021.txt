# Task ID: 21
# Title: Add Authentication and Security
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement API key authentication and security measures for the service.
# Details:
1. Create an authentication middleware for FastAPI
2. Implement API key validation
3. Store API keys securely (e.g., in Secret Manager)
4. Add rate limiting per API key
5. Implement request logging with authentication information
6. Add CORS configuration for web clients
7. Implement security headers
8. Add input validation and sanitization
9. Document security measures and API key management

# Test Strategy:
Test API endpoints with and without valid API keys. Verify rate limiting works correctly. Test CORS with different origins. Attempt common security exploits to ensure they are properly mitigated.
