# Task ID: 19
# Title: Integrate Components in /make Endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15, 16, 17, 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Connect all components to create a complete workflow from transcript ingestion to podcast generation and RSS feed update.
# Details:
1. Update the /make endpoint to orchestrate the full process
2. Implement sequential workflow: receive transcript → call NotebookLM API → store MP3 → update RSS feed
3. Add proper error handling at each step
4. Implement response generation with MP3 and RSS URLs
5. Add transaction logging for the entire process
6. Implement timeout handling for the complete workflow
7. Add progress tracking for long-running operations
8. Optimize performance where possible
9. Ensure proper cleanup of temporary resources

# Test Strategy:
Test the complete workflow with real transcripts. Verify all steps execute correctly and the final response contains valid URLs. Test error scenarios at each step to ensure proper handling. Measure end-to-end processing time for performance benchmarking.
