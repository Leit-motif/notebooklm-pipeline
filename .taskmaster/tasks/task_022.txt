# Priority: medium
# Description: Create functionality to preprocess and optimize chat transcripts for podcast generation.
# Details:
1. Implement text cleaning and normalization
2. Add functionality to handle special characters and formatting
3. Implement chunking for long transcripts
4. Create speaker identification and labeling
5. Add functionality to remove irrelevant content
6. Implement content structuring for better podcast flow
7. Add language detection and validation
8. Create functionality to handle code blocks and technical content
9. Implement metadata extraction from transcripts

# Test Strategy:
Test preprocessing with various transcript formats and lengths. Verify chunking works correctly for transcripts exceeding API limits. Test with multilingual content and special characters. Compare podcast quality with and without preprocessing to measure improvement.
