# Description: Develop a module to generate and maintain an RSS feed XML file for podcast episodes.
# Details:
1. Create an RSSGenerator class to handle feed creation and updates
2. Implement XML generation using a library like lxml or feedgen
3. Define the RSS feed structure with required podcast elements (title, description, image, etc.)
4. Implement method to add new episodes to the feed
5. Create functionality to upload the updated feed.xml to GCS
6. Implement validation to ensure valid XML
7. Add backup mechanism to prevent feed corruption
8. Implement concurrency handling for simultaneous updates
9. Add logging for feed operations

# Test Strategy:
Generate test RSS feeds with sample episodes and validate the XML structure. Test feed updates by adding multiple episodes. Verify the feed works in popular podcast apps like Overcast and Spotify. Test concurrent updates to ensure feed integrity.
